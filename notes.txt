# need a passage of time
# is this going to be a set up then run or turn based?
# how about both!
# initially turn based, but program saves the actions you did and does a single 
# run through at the end

# thinking of only using a 3x3 grid
# would be easier to calculate and min/max each cell
# more variety per cell (cell is a 3x3 grid)
# but less complexity
# if i am trying to have edge cells interact with each other, the smalled would 
# be better - saving the location as an index would be best then

# i like the vibe of console based"
